# Machine Learning Project: Heart Attack Risk Prediction

## Introduction
In this project, our objective is to predict whether an individual has a high or low risk of experiencing a heart attack. The dataset includes information about individuals and their corresponding risk levels.

## Methods Used
The project employs two machine learning methods:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree**

These methods were selected for their effectiveness in binary classification tasks and their interpretability.

For further details on each method and their performance, please refer to the project documentation.
